## Description

This Robotics project simulates and visualizes robot tasks in different lab sessions. The labs cover:

1. Coordinate Transforms 2D
2. Coordinate Transforms 3D
3. Virtual Camera
4. Camera Calibration
5. Forward Kinematics
6. Inverse Kinematics
7. Trajectories
8. Object Tracking
9. Deep Neural Network (DNN)

## Files

- **Camera**:
  - `Camera.cpp`: Defines a CCamera class that manages both virtual and real camera operations. Utilizing the OpenCV library, it provides functionality for initializing camera parameters, transforming 3D points to 2D image space, calibrating cameras, and interfacing with real webcams. Additionally, it offers tools for working with ChArUco boardsâ€”a type of fiducial marker used in computer vision.
  - `Camera.h`: Header for Camera.cpp.
- **README.md**: This document.
- **Robot**:
  - `Robot.cpp`: Represents the Scara-3 Robot's functionalities in terms of kinematics, camera interactions, and graphical representations in both virtual and real environments.
  - `Robot.h`: Header for Robot.cpp.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- cvui (for GUI elements)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV and required dependencies.
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Compile the project using a compatible C++ compiler.
